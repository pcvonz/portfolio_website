/*This was quite a pain to figure out. Lists have padding on them
for the bullets. If you try to apply a susy grid to a ul
element specifically, this padding throws off the grid. Wrap it in a div.

The second thing that really got me was susy context. It works the same way
that percentages work. If you span a div say 6 of 12, your new context is 6 columns
for all child objects.
