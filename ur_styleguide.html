  <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
  <p>The University Residences website is used by current students, future students, and parents alike. It houses information on</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Residence Halls</p></li>
  <li><p>Job opportunities</p></li>
  <li><p>A variety of web applications for external and internal use (Housing application, applying for housing, meal plan balance, roommate match)</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="the-problems">The Problems</h2>
  <div class="gallery ur-styleguide-color content-fullwidth">
    <div>
      <h3 id="high-turnover">High Turnover</h3>
      <p>ResTek has high turn over. All employees are students so they work for about four years before they graduate. The redesign has been a huge project for the web team. Work has started, stopped, scrapped, and started again multiple times.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 id="visual-cohesion">Visual Cohesion</h3>
      <p>University Residences is a sub brand under Western Washington University. Currently, the website does not follow the current brand guidelines. Ideally, it would identify as a unique brand that fits under the umbrella of WWU.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3 id="who-is-our-audience">Who is our audience?</h3>
      <p>There are so many vectors and people to think about when designing for a university website. There are incoming students, first generation college students, international students, parents, and returning students.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2 id="the-solutions">The solution(s)</h2>
  <p>The problem is really two fold.</p>
  <ul>
  <li><p>Internally, how does this mostly student run organization keep the project momentum going?</p></li>
  <li><p>Externally, how do we deliver a product which fulfills our myriad amount of users needs?</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="patternlab-an-interactive-styleguide">Patternlab: An Interactive Styleguide</h2>
  <p>I took inspiration from <a href="http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/">Brad
    Frost’s</a> book Atomic Design and the design system <a
    href="http://patternlab.io/">Patternlab</a>. I built on top of this program
  in order to serve the needs of our designers, developers, and stakeholders.
  ResTek builds internal and external web applications that
  all appear to be separate creations. Building a pattern library and styleguide
  would help ResTek create products that all appear to be under the umbrella
  of the ResTek brand and Western Washington University.</p>

    <div class="card">
      <h3 id="designers">Designers</h3>
      <p>An important part of the project is to make sure that designers can
      easily add their own styles to the project using all the tools they love
      (SASS, Susy, Breakpoint) and to make it easy for them to customize the
      workflow as web technologies continue to evolve.</p> </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3 id="developers">Developers</h3>
      <p>The styleguide needs to be a resource that is easy for developers to
      access so they can pull the latest skeleton code and minified CSS to hack
      a web app together quickly. Patternlab gives all of this to us for
      free.</p> </div>
    <div class="card">
      <h3 id="stakeholders">Stakeholders</h3>
      <p>Finally, stakeholders need to feel that this styleguide represents
      their voice. I branded it according to the WWU brand guide. This involved
      ripping out the base styles that come bundled with patternlab and giving
      it the WWU brand treatment.</p> </div>

  <h2 id="role">Role</h2>
  <p>Visual designer and front end programmer. The methodology I chose
  compartmentalized our problems from designing an entire website to designing
  the components of a website. Hopefully ensuring that even after I graduate the team
  will maintain the forward momentum we have gained. Work on the website is
  now thought through the lens of <em>atoms, molecules, and organisms</em>.
  reminiscent of how CSS frameworks are constructed, such as Bootstrap. I
  started from patternlab-node and then extended the build script to include
  all the tools our team uses. I also created mockups, conducted research, and
  established a visual direction for the redesign.</p>

  <h3 id="understanding-our-audience">Understanding our audience</h3>
  <p>ResTek has access to a few old hats when it comes to University Housing.
  They have a deep understanding of the process of applying and who applies.
  Consulting them and learning from them has been instrumental in establishing
  tone. We had our communication consultant mockup the landing page which gave us
  insight into what she believed to be the most important parts of the
  University Residences website.</p> 

  <h3 id="what-is-out-there-already">What is out there already?</h3>

  <p>A lot of housing websites exist and our in a similar state to ours.
  Considering competitor schools: WSU, UW, and Central, their housing 
  websites all lack in a specific area: </p>

  <p> <b> UW </b>visually does not fit with the university
  branding. The nav is focused generally on incoming students and important
  information (when students can apply) is hidden in a block of text.</p>

  <p><b>WSU</b> almost ticks all the marks for an
  exceptional Housing website. It hardly has any text, except for when the
  application is open. The bulk of the content is in videos that are properly
  captioned.</p> 
  
  <p><b>Central’s</b> website funnels people based on whether they are a new
  student or a current student. A lot of the information is hidden behind a
  carousel which not many people are going sift through. The side
  navigation has a lot of items, it takes a bit to get through all of them and
  half of them are hidden underneath a dropdown. The overall visual style isn’t
  cohesive.</p>
  <div class="case-study">
    <img src="images/case_study/comp_2.png" />
    <img src="images/case_study/comp_1.png" />
    <img src="images/case_study/comp_3.png" >
  </div>
  <h3 id="personas">Personas</h3>
  <p>A fellow colleague in another department compiled a list of detailed
  personas. ResTek itself also created what are known as proto personas as an
  onboarding technique for current staff. We had them create a persona based on
  their experiences. This highlighted internal biases when it comes to
  designing applications for users and also established sympathy for our
  diverse perspectives.</p> <h3 id="sitemap">Sitemap</h3>
  <p>The current sitemap was established from an inward facing direction rather
  than from a users perspective. We conducted an open card sort to establish which pages to include and then a
  closed card sort to see if our orginization made sense.</p> 
  
  <h3 id="patternlab">Patternlab</h3>

  <p>Starting with paper wireframes and a handful of atoms (base web
  components) we dove straight into creating more complex patterns in
  patternlab. They were then composed into layouts. Thinking about the
  smallest components and then composing them into larger patterns makes
  mocking up patterns using basic web technologies quickly.</p>

  <p>We have now begun work constructing a few common layouts
   common to the University Residences website based on the information
   from our stakeholders:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p><b>Content pages</b>, any sub page of the website that is mainly textual.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>Tour pages</b>, detailed pages that heavily rely on images. They give users information about WWU’s residence halls.</p></li>
    <li><p><b>The landing page</b>, a unique page that should push social media and tell visitors that our department is focused on fostering relationships between people.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Here is an example iteration of one of the content page layouts. The
  header image is a square grid of images, over time the squares fade to reveal
  the image underneath. The images are of students in the residence halls.
  Social media is the second item on the sight, emphasizing our goal to engage
  our users through social media.</p>

 <h2> Moving Forward </h2>

 <p>
 There is still a lot of work to be done. ResTek will continue to create
 paper wireframes, testing them, and then translating them into web layouts 
 through the principles of atomic design. The nature of the University
 Residences website makes the task of redesigning it quite a challenge. It will
 be crucial to continue this iterative pattern until we arrive at a solution
 that our stakeholders and audience will be able to 
 use with ease and pride.
