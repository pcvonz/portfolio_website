<h1> Secutor </h1>
  <p> Secutor is an app that is in ongoing development. </p>
<h2> The brief </h2>
<p> 
Secutor was inspired by the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique"> Pomodoro
  Technique</a>. The twist is that it triggers an
  event whenever a pomodoro is completed. I decided to build upon my web knowledge
  and try out ElectronJS. As of now, it connects to the 
  Habitica API and ticks off an item that Habitica keeps track of.  
</p>

<h2> Research </h2>
Initial design mockups were created and shared with some community members. Feedback was implemented into the design.
<h2> Implementation </h2>
I am using ElectronJS and gulp as a task runner. The frontend is manipulated using plain Javascript and RiotJS.
