  <h1> Godot Web Export </h1>
  <h2> The brief </h2>
    <p>
    Godot is a community made game making tool that can export projects to
    various platforms. One of the platforms Godot can target is the web. The
    upside of exporting to HTML5 is that almost anyone with a browser can load
    up and play your game, the downside is that it can take a considerable
    amount of time to load. From a developers perspective, there needs to be a
    quick and easy way to create a custom loader that fits into the brand of
    your game. An end user needs to know the progress of the download and that
    the game is loading. 
    </p> 
  <h2> Research </h2>
  <h2> Development </h3>
    <p> 
    Vueâ€™s component based system made mocking up and testing ideas a fast
    process. Hosting on GitHub meant that I had a quick way to update a static
    web page that could be shared with other Godot contributors providing the
    opportunity to receive feedback.

  <h2> Implementation </h2>
  <p> 
  Godot uses Emscripten to compile C++ into javascript/WASM. Contributor
  <i>eska</i> made a very simple template and placeholder animations. Implementing the
  new loader was a matter of modifying the template. In the interest of making
  this process as easy and straightforward as possible, I created a simple
  Webpack project with a small configuration file to modify the colors and
  logo. Now people can easily customize this project to generate a new
  template.
